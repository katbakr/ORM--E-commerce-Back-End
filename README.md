  ## Description
  This porject was built to be the backend for an e-commerce website. It would function as many large online retailers would with products, categories, and tags as forms or organization. This project was built using a MYSQL databse, sequelize, and a pre-built Express.js API. 

  ## Installation
  This project does require a few steps for installation: 
  * First step is to clone this repository into your local vscode through GitHub 
  * You will need to have Express.js, Node.js, sequelize, mysql2, and the external Insomnia app installed 
  * Next once you have the neccesary packaged installed using your terminal, sign into MySQL and run db/schema.sql to create the ecommerce database locally. After that, exit out of MySQL.
  * Next you need to see that new database by typing "npm run seed", seeds should start populating in your terminal.
  * Last, run "npm start" to start the server.

  ## Usage
This project has no front end usability, so all interaction has to be done using the Insomnia application to be able to visually see changes being made to the data through different routes. 

  Refer to the walkthrough below to see how to use this application on the CLI and Insomnia.
